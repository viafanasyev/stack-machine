# Stack machine

## Project description

This program is developed as a part of ISP RAS course.  

This program contains a register stack machine. It can assemble, disassemble and run programs. 
See Run section to find available operations and examples.

NOTE: This program works only on UNIX-like OS.

### Structure

* src/ : Main project
    * immortal-stack/ : Error-secure generic stack used in stack machine
        * stack.h : Definition and implementation of error-secure generic stack.
        * logger.h : Definition and implementation of logging functions and macros.
        * environment.h : Helper macros that are environment-dependent (OS, bitness, etc).
    * stack-machine.h, stack-machine.cpp : Simple stack machine implementation with ability to assemble, disassemble and run programs.
    * stack-machine-utils.h, stack-machine-utils.cpp : Helper functions for stack machine. Also contains used opcodes and errors.
    * main.cpp : Entry point for the program.

* test/ : Tests and testing library
    * testlib.h, testlib.cpp : Library for testing with assertions and helper macros.
    * stack-machine-tests.cpp : Tests for stack machine.
    * main.cpp : Entry point for tests. Just runs all tests.

* examples/ : Files with code of examples given below

* doc/ : doxygen documentation

* Doxyfile : doxygen config file

### Run

#### Stack machine

To run main program execute next commands in terminal:
```shell script
cmake . && make
./stack-machine --help                          # To see help
./stack-machine --asm file.txt                  # To assemble file with code. Result is put in file.asm
./stack-machine --asm file1.txt -o file2.asm    # To assemble file with code. Result is put in file2.asm
./stack-machine --disasm file.asm               # To disassemble asm file. Result is put in file__disassembly.txt
./stack-machine --disasm file1.asm -o file2.txt # To disassemble asm file. Result is put in file2.txt
./stack-machine --run file.asm                  # To run asm file
```

Only one --asm, --disasm, --run option could be used at the time.

##### Available operations

File with code can contain next operations:
```
IN          # Read double value from console and put it on stack
OUT         # Pop value from stack and write it in console
POP         # Pop value from stack
POP AX      # Pop value from stack and put it into register
PUSH 1.5    # Put the given value on top of the stack
PUSH AX     # Put the value from register on top of the stack
ADD         # Pop two values from stack and put (lhs + rhs) on top of the stack
SUB         # Pop two values from stack and put (lhs - rhs) on top of the stack
MUL         # Pop two values from stack and put (lhs * rhs) on top of the stack
DIV         # Pop two values from stack and put (lhs / rhs) on top of the stack
SQRT        # Pop one value from stack and put the square root on top of the stack
DUP         # Duplicates value on top of the stack
JMP LABEL   # Unconditional jump to the given label
JMPE LABEL  # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs == rhs) (compared using 1e-9 epsilon)
JMPNE LABEL # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs != rhs) (compared using 1e-9 epsilon)
JMPL LABEL  # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs <  rhs)
JMPLE LABEL # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs <= rhs)
JMPG LABEL  # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs >  rhs)
JMPGE LABEL # Pop two values from the stack and jump to the given label if (lhs >= rhs)
HLT         # Stop the program

* rhs - value on top of the stack, lhs - value under rhs
```

Program should end with `HLT` command, otherwise it's behaviour is undefined.  

Each command should be on separate line.  

Possible registers: `AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`.  

Labels have to be written on separate lines, can not contain spaces and must end with `:` symbol. Example: `START:` (see more examples below).

##### Examples

Example program 1 (square root of sum):
```
IN
IN
ADD
SQRT
OUT
HLT
```

Example program 2 (square root of the squared value minus 2):
```
IN
POP AX
PUSH AX
PUSH AX
MUL
PUSH 2
SUB
SQRT
OUT
HLT
```

Example program 3 (infinite cycle: read number and print it's square root):
```
START:     <-- Label should be on separate line
IN
SQRT
OUT
JMP START
HLT        <-- Not necessary
```

All examples can be found in `examples` directory.

#### Tests

To run tests execute next commands in terminal:
```
cmake . && make
./tests
```
